## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the Chrome Debugger with JavaScript, how to use JavaScript for form validation, and how to use regular expressions and the __test()__ method to check inputs(strings). Additionally, I learned how to work with CSS classes using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I will continue learning JavaScript and improving my ability to handle forms using JS. I will also keep using the Chrome Debugger for testing.
